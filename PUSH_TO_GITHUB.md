# Push this repo to GitHub (NEW-arbitrage-scanner)

Your code is committed locally. To put it on GitHub:

1. **Create a new repo on GitHub**
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Repository name: **NEW-arbitrage-scanner**
   - Leave "Add a README" **unchecked** (we already have one)
   - Create the repository

2. **Push** (remote is already set to `seniortech/NEW-arbitrage-scanner`)
   ```bash
   cd /Users/seniortech/Downloads/IDKARBBOT
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If your GitHub username is **not** seniortech, fix the remote first:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW-arbitrage-scanner.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **SSH users:** use `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/NEW-arbitrage-scanner.git` as the remote URL.

Done. Repo will be at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW-arbitrage-scanner`.
